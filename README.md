# Find Date Range By Day Month and Year with Postgresql


The principal purpose of the code written in the getDateRange.sql file is to find the difference between 2 dates using PostgreSQL.
If we take a closer look, the meaning of date range here is the difference between the employee's starting and leaving dates. If the employee has not left the job and is still in the employee position, the get_date_range function takes today's date as end_date and calculates accordingly.

You can find the relevant codes in the getDateRange.sql file.
